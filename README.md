Technologies:

node js
express
mongo
mongoose


Great! we are working with a popular stack using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This stack is widely used for building backend APIs, web applications, and services. Here's a quick overview of the technologies and how they work together, followed by a basic example setup:


**
Technologies Overview
**

Node.js:



JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

Allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

Excellent for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.

**
Express.js:**

A lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework.
Simplifies handling routes, middleware, and request/response logic.

**MongoDB:**

A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

Ideal for applications that require a dynamic schema.


**Mongoose:
**


An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

Provides schema-based validation and simplifies interactions with MongoDB.


**Basic Project Setup**

Below is an example of how to create a simple CRUD API using these technologies.

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to initialize a Node.js project and install the required dependencies:


mkdir my-app
cd my-app
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose body-parser dotenv


express: For building the server.

mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB.

body-parser: To parse JSON payloads in requests.

dotenv: To manage environment variables (e.g., database connection string).
